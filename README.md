# The-JavaScript-Quiz

A timed quiz on basic JavaScript that stores users scores.

When you press start you are presented with questions. When a question is answered another question appears and when a question is answered wrong 5 seconds is subtracted from the clock. When all the questions are answered  or the timer reaches 0, the game is over. Then you see your score.
